              <h1>Improvements</h1>
              <p>Hello. These are just my notes on the possible improvements. There are a lot of things I could do to make this better and they are in two categores.

              </p>
              <h2> Improvements on the coding side</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The biggest one is performance. There are some queries that timeout before my script can scrape kijiji. 'Cars' seems to take very long, and does not
                    beat the 30s timer enforced by heroku. I'm not sure how to fix this, and trust me I've tried. What is infuriating is that there is a wild variance in 
                    completion time depending on the query, but also depending on the day. I am not sure why this is the case.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Ebay's implementation could use some work. The current implentation of it is quite naive and bare bones and leads to some serious issues
                    on certain queries. The reason I don't want to do it is because their API is massive, and also I'm not even sure it's a solvable issue.
                    Since my tool only allows the user to search using keywords, there is a certain limit on the fidelity of the searches. For example, there are some
                    nonsense results that spike at 1 or 2 dollars for an item that is supposed to be hundreds of dollars.
                  </li>
                  
                </ul>


          
                <h2> Improvements on everything else</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>The first thing that comes to mind is the inclusion of craigslist ( and other used-goods websites)</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>A cool thing I could do to make this tool more buyer-oriented is have the graph be interactive. I could
                      feasable make the graph clickable at the price points, and have a url to which ad is broacasting the price.
                    </p>
                    </li>
