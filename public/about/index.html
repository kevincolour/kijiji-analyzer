  <h1>About</h1>
          <p>
            Hello, and thanks for coming and making all this typing at least a little bit worth it. Welcome to the about page
            and specifically welcome to the about section. Here I will describe what this application is. This application was built
            with the intention of 
          </p>

          <h3>Methodology</h3>
          <p>Here, I will describe how I attained the data. For Kijiji, the keywords in the input box are searched for in Kijiji's own search engine. 
          This means that one can check the validity of the results by searching for the keyword with the location on the kijiji's site. 
          The first 100 pages of the query is analyzed, and any paid ad is removed. Any ad that doesn't list a price is also removed from the dataset. All decimal values
          are rounded up into an integer and fed into chart.js's API. 
        </p>
          <p>
            Ebay has a very extensive and detailed api, and so attaining the data was just a matter of a simple GET request with the right parameters.
            It is important to note here that eBay especially suffers from the lack of categorization. I attempted to circumnavigate this by analyzing the first 
            page of the results which I thought would have the most relevant products and averaging them out to gain knowledge of what values are expected.
            I then allowed any value within 50% of the average in either positive or negative direction to be admitted into the data set.

          </p>


          <h3>Possible Issues and Limitations</h3>
        <p>There are certain considerations when interpreting the data. Firstly, it is important to note that I am infact a human and as a proud human I may have made errors in my execution
            of this application. This means that the data might be wrong due to an unforseen circumstance. I hope for both our sakes that this doesn't happen. Secondly
            there is the issue of the limited utility of the application due to the restricted variety of used goods it can be used on. This application works best
            when it is used for goods that do not vary- an ideal example would be a specific type of smartphone. An awful item to search for would be something where quality and consequently
            price varies. Searching for a dress, for example, would not be recommended. Indeed the program only works as much as the person using it
            intelligently selects the keywords. Searching for a smartphone instead of an iPhone 6 will yield comically different results. Finally, there is the problem involving 
            interpretation of the graphs presented. Average, mode, and median are all useful metrics in gauging the worth of a product, but a measly three numbers only
            hold so much information. The graphs are there to supplement the three numbers, but there is a certain skill in being able to read and deduce what the graphs imply. 
            For example, when searching for a graphics card, say a gtx 1060, there is no feature that isolates the query into searching only for the computer accessory. Unfortunately,
            entire gaming computers will show up in the data, making the average, mean, and mode less useful. However, one can look at the graphs presented and
            come up with a better-than-nothing guess of the price of a used graphics card by mentally eliminating the data points above a certain threshold. However, the data is 
            unclear when using this method, and there is limited utility gained from situations such as these.
